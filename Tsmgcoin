Tsmgcoin is a block chain based marketplace
Automatic matching of buyers & sellers via unique artificial intelligence approach.
With the blockchain innovation of technological superiority, electronic transactions are made easier, faster, cheaper but more secure. If banks can be robbed or declared bankrupt, cryptocurrencies, crypto exchanges and wallet developers can also steal. When you do this in the crypto industry, the serial codes of each traded crat unit are saved and remain in your crypto wallet. Hackers use hardware wallets to protect their caches. TSMG serial codes (TRC-20) can now be stored indefinitely
